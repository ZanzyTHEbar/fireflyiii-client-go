# Firefly API Stubs

This repo is dedicated to generating a go-client for the `firefly-iii-6.2.8` OpenAPI 3.0 specification file.

This specification can be found [here](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/firefly-iii-6.2.8-v1.yaml).

The root spec can be found here: https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org

I will do my best to keep this up to date with the latest version of the API.

If this is not the latest version, please open an issue and I will update it.

Please note that this is a work in progress and may not be complete.

If the custom client is not complete or does not work, please open an issue and I will do my best to fix it.

I welcome any contributions to this repo.
